<h2>What is this project</h2>
<h4>This is just a little prototype that I'm making to put in my portfolio to achieve my first job.
  <br>
  It'll simulate an academy site. The name I chose is a bit weird, but I still like it.</h4>

<h2>How long I'll work on it</h2>
<h4>I'll stop updating this project in exactly one month, to see how much I improve in one month of work.
  <br>
  I'll start another "1-month project" as soon as I stop updating this one and I'll keep doing this for 1 year.</h4>
  
<h2>Why I'm making this project</h2>
<h4>I'm making this mainly for experience and to see how much I can "evolve" in such time space</h4>
